# Mythic Hostpial
This is a lightweight hosptial & limb damage resource. This was largely done as an experiment so some of it is rough around the edges.

Dependencies :
- [Mythic Notify](https://github.com/mythicrp/mythic_notify)


> NOTE: While I have removed my framework base as a dependency, there are some aspects of this that due not work because of that. As such it'd be on you to implement. Need to add things like billing taking money from the player, syncing injuries in database to they're persistent, adding usable items for the various effects, etc.
